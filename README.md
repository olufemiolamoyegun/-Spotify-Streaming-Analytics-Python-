## 📌 Project Description
Analyze **Spotify-style music streaming data** to uncover insights about track popularity, audio features, and listener engagement.  
Supports **playlist optimization, growth analytics, and product decisions** using a **synthetic dataset** for portfolio purposes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify factors influencing track popularity  
- Analyze relationships between audio features and listener engagement  
- Explore long-tail distributions and engagement patterns  

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **File:** `Spotify_Tracks_Synthetic.csv`  
- **Records:** 5,000+ tracks  
- **Type:** Synthetic, portfolio-safe  

| Column        | Description                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| streams       | Number of streams per track           |
| popularity    | Track popularity score                |
| danceability  | Danceability rating of the track      |
| energy        | Energy level of the track             |
| tempo         | Tempo of the track (BPM)             |
| duration_ms   | Track duration in milliseconds        |

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn

## 🔍 Analysis Overview
- Data validation & cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Distribution analysis of streams & popularity  
- Correlation analysis between audio features & engagement metrics  
- Identification of high-performing track profiles  

---

## 📈 Key Findings
- Higher **energy** and **danceability** → more streams  
- Very long tracks → lower engagement  
- Track popularity follows a **long-tail distribution**
