# 🎵 Spotify Streaming Analytics

## 📌 Project Description
This repository contains a **product and growth analytics project** analyzing music streaming behavior using a **synthetic Spotify-style dataset**. The analysis focuses on track popularity, audio features, and listener engagement to generate **data-driven insights** that support product and playlist optimization decisions.

> **Note:** The dataset is synthetic and created strictly for portfolio and educational purposes.

## 📊 Dataset
- **File:** `Spotify_Tracks_Synthetic.csv`  
- **Records:** 5,000+ tracks  
- **Type:** Synthetic, non-Kaggle, portfolio-safe  

**Key Columns:**  
- `streams` – Number of streams per track  
- `popularity` – Track popularity score  
- `danceability` – Danceability rating of the track  
- `energy` – Energy level of the track  
- `tempo` – Tempo of the track (BPM)  
- `duration_ms` – Track duration in milliseconds  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify factors influencing track popularity  
- Analyze relationships between audio features and listener engagement  
- Understand distribution patterns typical of streaming platforms  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- **Python** – Data analysis and modeling  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  

---

## 🔍 Analysis Overview
- Data validation and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Distribution analysis of streams and popularity  
- Correlation analysis between audio features and engagement metrics  
- Identification of high-performing track profiles  

---

## 📈 Key Findings
- Higher **energy** and **danceability** are positively correlated with increased streams  
- Extremely long track durations are associated with lower listener engagement  
- Track popularity follows a **long-tail distribution**, common in digital content platforms  

---

## 💡 Business Use Cases
- Playlist optimization based on high-engagement audio features  
- Data-informed music promotion strategies  
- Support for experimentation and A/B testing in playlist curation
